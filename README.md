# Fillout_Take_home_Yue

This is the take-home assessment for **Fillout**.

It implements the following features:

- ✅ Show a **series of form pages** (e.g. “Info”, “Details”, “Other”, “Ending”)
- ✅ Support **drag-to-reorder** form pages
- ✅ Support **adding a new page** between any two existing pages via a **"+" button** that appears on hover
- ✅ Each page supports a **context menu** (rename, duplicate, delete — buttons are non-functional)
- ✅ **Highlight the active page** and allow selecting other pages

All application state is maintained **in-memory** — no backend is used.
